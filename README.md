# wazuh-deploy
Automation script for single host Wazuh deployment. (Debian/Ubuntu based)
This script was created to simplify the deployment of Wazuh in mass testing exercises. I take no responsibility for the consequences of running this script, it works for me :)

Tested on Ubuntu Server 16.04.3 LTS December 2017
